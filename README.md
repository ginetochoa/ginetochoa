- 👋 Hi, I’m @ginetochoa
- 👀 I’m interested in astrology, dogs, cats, nature, woodworking, coding, and I'm intrested in finding a friend who is also learning how to code to work together.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Html + CSS on freecodecamp+W3school+youtube, excited to get my certificate to move on to JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project I can be a part of. I like to work in teams and learn from more experienced peers.
